# Fun with File Extensions

## Description 

Now that we have their company website, it will be helpful for us to know how the company layout is like. <br>
Note: <br>
This challenge does not require brute-forcing. There is no need to do so.

## Solution 

In the same google search, the company's website is also found. 
![website](https://github.com/mashmllo/CDDC2020-Writeup/blob/master/OSINT/Fun%20with%20File%20Extensions/webpage.jpg)
Basic reconnaissance is done on the website to look for potential files that contain the flag. A pdf file is found in the 'About Us' section. 
The file is downloaded and is opened in Adobe Acrobat. Using the edit pdf tool, the flag is found.
