# My Best Friend, Julius!

## Descrption
Julius is always sending me cryptic messages. Hmm. <br>
JHLZHY_ZLSSZ_ZLHZOLSSZ_IF_AOL_ZLHZOVYL <br>
Note: <br>
Decrypted text does not include the flag format “CDDC20{}”. Add in the flag format “CDDC20{}” during submission, and ensure that the flag string is fully in uppercase, i.e. CDDC20{SAMPLE_FLAG}.

## Solution 

Since the title of the challenge states Julius, it can be implied that Caesar Cipher is used. Using an [online decrypter](https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher), the hash is decrypted.

## Flag

CDDC20{CAESAR_SELLS_SEASHELLS_BY_THE_SEASHORE}
