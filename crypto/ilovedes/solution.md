# ilovedes

## Attached file 

[secret.dat](https://github.com/mashmllo/CDDC2020-Writeup/blob/master/crypto/ilovedes/secret.dat)

## Solution 

Since the title of the challenge is ilovedes, the file is decrpyted with DES. However, a key is required, thus the title of the challenge is used as the key. The flag is then shown.
